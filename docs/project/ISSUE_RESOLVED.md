# 🎉 Grant AI Integration - ISSUE RESOLVED!

## ✅ Problem Fixed Successfully

**Issue**: The GUI was crashing with `AttributeError: 'PredictiveGrantDatabase' object has no attribute 'get_all_grants'`

**Root Cause**: The `PredictiveGrantDatabase` class was missing:
1. The `@dataclass` decorator
2. The `get_all_grants()` method

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### Fixed `PredictiveGrantDatabase` Class:
```python
@dataclass  # ← Added missing decorator
class PredictiveGrantDatabase:
    """Database for managing predictive grants."""
    
    grants: List[PredictiveGrant] = field(default_factory=list)
    
    def get_all_grants(self) -> List[PredictiveGrant]:  # ← Added missing method
        """Get all grants in the database."""
        return self.grants.copy()
    
    # ... existing methods ...
```

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Added `@dataclass` decorator** to `PredictiveGrantDatabase` class
2. **Added `get_all_grants()` method** that returns a copy of all grants
3. **Maintained data integrity** by returning a copy of the grants list

## ✅ Verification Complete

### 🧪 Tests Passed:
- ✅ Module loads without errors
- ✅ `PredictiveGrantDatabase` can be instantiated  
- ✅ `get_all_grants()` method exists and works
- ✅ GUI launches successfully without crashes
- ✅ All integration validation checks pass

### 🚀 Current Status:
```bash
# Launch GUI (now working!)
./run.sh gui

# Validate integration
./run.sh validate-integration
```
