  - Grant milestones and progress tracking
  - Budget breakdown and financial analysis
  - Statistics and analytics dashboard
  - Organization context-aware filtering
  - Document opening and viewing functionality

### 3. Data Models
- **Predictive Grant Model**: `src/grant_ai/models/predictive_grant.py`
  - `PredictiveGrant` class with all necessary fields
  - `PredictiveGrantDatabase` for data management
  - Sample data creation functions
  - Status tracking and prediction algorithms

- **Enhanced Past Grant Model**: `src/grant_ai/models/enhanced_past_grant.py`
  - `EnhancedPastGrant` class with comprehensive fields
  - `GrantDocument` and `GrantMilestone` supporting classes
  - Document management and opening capabilities
  - Sample data creation with realistic examples

### 4. GUI Integration
- **Main Window Updated**: `src/grant_ai/gui/qt_app.py`
  - Both new tabs added to the main tabbed interface
  - Organization profile signal connections established
  - Profile change propagation to new tabs
  - Proper tab ordering and labeling

### 5. Organization Context Integration
- Both tabs now respond to organization profile changes
- Automatic filtering based on selected organization
- Context-aware grant relevance scoring
- Real-time updates when profile changes

## 🚀 How to Use

### Starting the Application
```bash
# Setup (if not done already)
./run.sh setup

# Launch GUI
./run.sh gui
```

### Using the New Tabs
1. **Set Organization Profile**: Go to "Organization Profile" tab and select an organization (e.g., "Coda Mountain Academy")
2. **View Predictive Grants**: Switch to "Predictive Grants" tab to see expected future opportunities
3. **Review Past Grants**: Use "Enhanced Past Grants" tab to see detailed history and documents
