# AttributeError Fix Summary

## Issue
The Enhanced Past Grants tab was throwing an AttributeError when filtering grants for organization context:

```
AttributeError: 'EnhancedPastGrant' object has no attribute 'organization'
```

This occurred on line 925 in `src/grant_ai/gui/enhanced_past_grants_tab.py` in the `apply_organization_filter()` method.

## Root Cause
The code was checking `hasattr(grant, 'organization')` but then directly accessing `grant.organization` in a conditional expression. Even though the hasattr check existed, the direct attribute access could still fail if the object didn't have the attribute.

## Fix Applied
Changed the problematic code from:
```python
if org_name and hasattr(grant, 'organization'):
    org_relevance = (
        org_name.lower() in grant.organization.lower() if grant.organization
        else False
    )
```

To:
```python
if org_name and hasattr(grant, 'organization'):
    grant_org = getattr(grant, 'organization', '')
    org_relevance = (
        org_name.lower() in grant_org.lower() if grant_org
        else False
    )
```

## Changes Made
- Used `getattr(grant, 'organization', '')` to safely retrieve the organization value with a default empty string
- Stored the result in a local variable `grant_org` before using it
- This prevents AttributeError while maintaining the same filtering logic

## Testing
- GUI launches successfully without AttributeError
- Organization filtering should now work correctly
- Defensive programming approach prevents similar issues

## File Modified
- `src/grant_ai/gui/enhanced_past_grants_tab.py` (line ~925)
