# Grant Research AI Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an AI-powered system for researching and managing grant applications for non-profit organizations, specifically CODA and Christian Pocket Community/NRG Development.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **AI Company Research**: Research and filter AI companies based on reputation and target audience
2. **Grant Database**: Create a comprehensive database of grant programs
3. **Matching Algorithm**: Develop algorithms to match organizations with suitable grants
4. **Application Management**: Streamline the grant application process

### Target Organizations

#### CODA
- **Focus**: Education programs in music, art, and robotics
- **Programs**: After-school programs and summer camps
- **Target Grants**: Education-focused, youth development, arts & technology

#### Christian Pocket Community/NRG Development
- **Focus**: Affordable, efficient housing for retired people
- **Additional Support**: Housing for struggling single mothers and others in need
- **Target Grants**: Housing & development, social services, community support

## Project Phases
