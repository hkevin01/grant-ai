## 🚀 Next Steps - Phase 6 Enhancements

### Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Weeks)

#### 1. AI-Powered Grant Matching Enhancement
**Goal**: Improve matching accuracy from current level to 90%+
```bash
# Implementation plan:
- Add semantic similarity using sentence-transformers
- Implement ML-based scoring with historical data
- Create feedback loop for user-marked successful applications
```

#### 2. Advanced Data Sources Integration
**Goal**: Expand grant database with major foundation sources
```bash
# Sources to add:
- Ford Foundation grants API
- Gates Foundation (where applicable)
- State community foundation directories
- Corporate giving programs database
```

#### 3. Real-time Grant Monitoring
**Goal**: Automated discovery of new grant opportunities
```bash
# Features to implement:
- Background service checking for new grants daily
- Email notifications for relevant matches
- RSS feed monitoring system
- Grant deadline alert system
```

### Medium-term Goals (Next 2-4 Weeks)

#### 4. Advanced Application Management
- Smart template generation based on grant requirements
- Collaboration features for team-based applications
- Version control for application drafts
- Automated requirement checklist validation

#### 5. Analytics & Business Intelligence
- Success rate tracking and analysis
- Predictive modeling for grant success probability
- ROI analysis (funding received vs time invested)
- Competition level assessment

#### 6. System Integration & API
- QuickBooks integration for budget data
- CRM system connections
- Project management tool integrations
- RESTful API for third-party access
