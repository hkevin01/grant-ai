## Configuration

### Proposal Structure
Each proposal contains:
- **Metadata**: Title, grant ID, organization, agency, deadline, funding amount
- **Sections**: Individual proposal sections with content, word limits, and requirements
- **Collaboration**: Notes, version history, and team feedback
- **AI Integration**: Generated suggestions and review feedback

### Section Types
1. **Specific Aims**: Research objectives and approaches
2. **Project Narrative**: Problem statement, solution, and impact
3. **Budget Narrative**: Detailed cost justifications

### AI Prompt System
The system uses sophisticated prompts for different contexts:
- **Generation Prompts**: Create new content based on proposal context
- **Review Prompts**: Analyze existing content for improvement
- **Enhancement Prompts**: Suggest specific improvements

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Research Proposal
```python
# Create proposal for education research
proposal_id = ai_writing_assistant.create_proposal(
    title="AI-Enhanced Music Education Platform",
    grant_id="NEA-2024-ARTS-TECH",
    organization_id="CODA"
)

# Set proposal metadata
proposal = ai_writing_assistant.proposals[proposal_id]
proposal.metadata.update({
    "agency": "National Endowment for the Arts",
    "program": "Arts and Technology",
    "funding_amount": "$750,000",
    "deadline": "2024-12-15"
