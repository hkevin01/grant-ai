# Grant AI Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Grant AI project, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. All tests must be run using the project's venv.

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for all core modules (models, analysis, CLI, scrapers)
- Integration tests for database, scrapers, and GUI
- End-to-end tests for user workflows (profile creation, grant search, application management)
- Manual exploratory testing for GUI and edge cases

## Test Categories
- Unit Tests: Validate individual modules and functions
- Integration Tests: Ensure components work together as expected
- End-to-End Tests: Simulate real user workflows
- Performance Tests: Measure speed and resource usage
- Security Tests: Identify vulnerabilities
