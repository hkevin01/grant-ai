# Grant AI Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Grant AI project, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. All tests must be run using the project's venv.

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for all core modules (models, analysis, CLI, scrapers)
- Integration tests for database, scrapers, and GUI
- End-to-end tests for user workflows (profile creation, grant search, application management)
- Manual exploratory testing for GUI and edge cases

## Test Categories
- Unit Tests: Validate individual modules and functions
- Integration Tests: Ensure components work together as expected
- End-to-End Tests: Simulate real user workflows
- Performance Tests: Measure speed and resource usage
- Security Tests: Identify vulnerabilities

## Test Coverage Goals
- âœ… Organization, Grant, and AICompany models
- âœ… GrantResearcher analysis and matching
- âœ… CLI commands for profile and grant management
- âœ… Scrapers for grants.gov API integration
- âœ… Application management system (questionnaire, templates, tracking, reporting)
- âœ… Database integration and persistence
- ðŸ”„ GUI workflows (profile, search, results) - partially tested
- ðŸ”„ End-to-end user workflows - in progress

## Test Execution
- All tests must be run with the venv activated
- Test output should be logged to logs/test_output_log.md for review

## Test Types
- âœ… Unit tests (pytest) - comprehensive coverage
- âœ… Integration tests - database and service layer
- ðŸ”„ End-to-end tests - in progress
- ðŸ”„ Manual/Exploratory tests - ongoing

## Test Tools
- âœ… pytest - primary testing framework
- âœ… pytest-cov - code coverage reporting
- âœ… PyQt testing - GUI component testing
- âœ… SQLAlchemy - database integration testing
- âœ… Mock/fixtures - isolated unit testing
