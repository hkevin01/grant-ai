### üöÄ Immediate Usage
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Create organization profiles
grant-ai profile create --name "Your Org" --focus-area education

# View existing profiles  
grant-ai profile show coda_profile.json

# Research commands (framework ready for implementation)
grant-ai research research-companies --focus education
grant-ai match grants coda_profile.json
grant-ai match companies coda_profile.json
```
