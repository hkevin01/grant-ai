## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Fork and Setup
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-for-grant-writing.git
cd ai-for-grant-writing

# Add Grant AI as a remote
git remote add grant-ai https://github.com/your-username/grant-ai.git
```

### Step 2: Enhance Services Table
Add Grant AI to the useful services table:

| Service | Grant Research | Writing Assistance | Application Tracking | Free Tier |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| [Grant AI](https://github.com/your-username/grant-ai) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Step 3: Create Integration Module
```python
# In Grant AI, create a new module
src/grant_ai/services/grant_writing.py

class GrantWritingAssistant:
    """AI-powered grant writing assistance using prompts from ai-for-grant-writing"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.prompts = self.load_prompts()
    
    def enhance_clarity(self, text):
        """Enhance text clarity using AI for Grant Writing prompts"""
        prompt = self.prompts['clarity']['enhance']
        return self.generate_improvement(text, prompt)
    
    def make_compelling(self, text):
        """Make text more compelling for grant reviewers"""
        prompt = self.prompts['compelling']['persuasive']
        return self.generate_improvement(text, prompt)
    
    def align_with_mission(self, text, funding_agency):
        """Align text with funding agency mission"""
        prompt = self.prompts['alignment']['mission'].format(agency=funding_agency)
        return self.generate_improvement(text, prompt)
```

### Step 4: Add CLI Commands
```python
# Add to Grant AI CLI
@cli.command()
def writing_assistant():
    """Launch AI-powered grant writing assistant"""
    assistant = GrantWritingAssistant()
    assistant.interactive_mode()

@cli.command()
@click.argument('text_file')
@click.option('--enhance', is_flag=True, help='Enhance text clarity')
@click.option('--compelling', is_flag=True, help='Make text more compelling')
def improve_text(text_file, enhance, compelling):
    """Improve grant writing text using AI prompts"""
    assistant = GrantWritingAssistant()
    with open(text_file, 'r') as f:
        text = f.read()
    
    if enhance:
        improved = assistant.enhance_clarity(text)
    elif compelling:
        improved = assistant.make_compelling(text)
    
    print(improved)
```

### Step 5: Create Cross-References
