## 🔮 Next Priority Recommendations

Based on your strategic roadmap, here are the next highest-impact features to implement:

### **Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)**

#### 1. 🤖 **AI-Powered Grant Writing Assistant**
```bash
# Would add CLI commands like:
grant-ai ai write-proposal --grant-id="NASA_GRANT_001" --org="CODA"
grant-ai ai review-proposal --file="proposal.docx"
grant-ai ai suggest-improvements --proposal="draft.pdf"
```

#### 2. 📊 **Real-time Grant Monitoring**
```bash
# Would add CLI commands like:
grant-ai monitor start --sources="grants.gov,nsf,nasa"
grant-ai monitor alerts --organization="CODA"
grant-ai monitor dashboard
```

#### 3. 🔍 **Enhanced Grant Discovery with ML**
```bash
# Would add CLI commands like:
grant-ai discover intelligent --profile="coda.json"
grant-ai discover trends --focus-area="education"
grant-ai discover similar --grant-id="successful_grant_123"
```

### **Medium Term (1-2 months)**

#### 4. 📱 **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
- Mobile-optimized interface using same Material Design
- Offline capability for grant review
- Push notifications for deadlines
