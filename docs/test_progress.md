# Grant Research AI Test Progress

## Phase 1: Unit Test Progress
- [x] OrganizationProfile model: tested (fields, validation, methods)
- [x] Grant model: tested (fields, matching, scoring)
- [x] AICompany model: tested (fields, reputation, matching)
- [x] GrantResearcher analysis: tested (matching, reporting)
- [x] CLI commands: tested (profile, show, examples)
- [ ] Scrapers (base and state/federal): test stubs created, implementation in progress
- [ ] GUI (basic workflows): test stubs created, implementation in progress

## Next Steps
- [ ] Expand unit tests for scrapers (mock grant data)
- [ ] Add unit tests for GUI logic (Streamlit components)
- [ ] Begin integration tests for database and scraper pipeline

## Integration Tests
- [ ] Database read/write
- [ ] Scraper-to-database pipeline
- [ ] GUI-to-database connection

## End-to-End Tests
- [ ] User creates profile, searches grants, saves results
- [ ] User applies for grant and tracks application

## Manual/Exploratory
- [ ] GUI usability and edge cases
- [ ] Error handling and validation

## Coverage
- Current: ~67% (unit tests)
- Target: 80%+
