  "description": "Coda Mountain Academy is a non-profit organization dedicated to equipping and developing young students and their families through unique and outstanding educational opportunities. Nestled deep in the Appalachian country, Coda's home is right in the middle of the dazzling New River Gorge in Fayetteville, West Virginia. We address the unprecedented crisis of drug and alcohol addiction affecting youth from every income and cultural background by providing a natural and safe place to belong, someone to believe in them, and engagement in meaningful and exciting activities. We use Arts Integration to develop exposure and opportunities that promote healthy goal setting, positive identity, strong character, resiliency, and life skills. In 2018, Coda provided over 500 youth and their families with summer camps and after-school programs. These programs not only train students in their particular craft but promote invaluable life skills such as team building, integrity, positive self-image, and outstanding character. Coda hopes to change the world, one child at a time.",
