# Grant Research AI Project Instructions

This is a Python project for researching and managing grant applications for non-profit organizations. The project focuses on:

1. **Grant Research**: Identifying and filtering AI companies and grant programs suitable for specific non-profit needs
2. **Application Management**: Streamlining the grant application process
3. **Organization Profiles**: Managing information for different organizations (CODA, NRG Development, etc.)

## Key Organizations:

- **CODA**: Focuses on education programs in music, art, and robotics; offers after-school programs and summer camps
- **Christian Pocket Community/NRG Development**: Developing affordable, efficient housing for retired people with support for struggling single mothers and others in need

## Project Structure:

- Use src-layout Python project structure
- Maintain clear separation between data collection, analysis, and application management
- Follow Python best practices for modular, testable code
- Include comprehensive documentation and progress tracking

## Code Guidelines:

- Write clean, well-documented Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Create unit tests for critical functionality
- Use appropriate libraries for web scraping, data analysis, and API interactions

## Focus Areas:

- Research methodologies for finding relevant grants
- Data structures for storing grant and organization information
- Filtering and matching algorithms
- Report generation and progress tracking
